# FirebaseChatAppAd

In order to show google ads, you have to replace device id on ChatListFragment with the device you run the app in android studio.
  *ads may not appear because they run on test mode.

To test app, you should turn off animations from settings -> developer options, and run LoginFragmentTest or MainActivityTest in android studio.
